# PV-OPTIM - Smart Adaptive Optimization and Control Software for Prosumers

- PV forecast 
- PV monitor
- Day-ahead consumption optimization

For set-up and configuration please read the PV-OPTIM Configuration Guide.

In case you do not want to configure the smart-plugs and the orchestration flow, you may use PV-OPTIM to forecast the PV output and to optimally schedule the consumption (Layer 1). For this purpose, a new version of PV-OPTIM for PV forecast and optimization will be available soon as a standalone web application.
